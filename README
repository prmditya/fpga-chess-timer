# FPGA Chess Timer

This repository contains the implementation of an FPGA-based Chess Timer. The project aims to design and develop a chess timer using an FPGA, providing precise time management and control during chess games.

## Features

- **Time Tracking**: Tracks and displays time for both players.
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Enables players to start and stop their timers accurately.
- **Reset Timer**: Resets the timer to the initial configuration.
- **User Interface**: Uses LED displays or LCD for visual feedback.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- FPGA Development Board (e.g., Altera DE10-Lite, Xilinx Artix-7, etc.)
- FPGA Toolchain (e.g., Quartus, Vivado, etc.)
- Basic understanding of Verilog/VHDL
- USB Blaster or equivalent for programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prmditya/fpga-chess-timer.git
   ```
2. Open the project files in your preferred FPGA IDE.

### Synthesis and Programming

1. Synthesize the design using your FPGA IDE.
2. Generate the bitstream file.
3. Upload the bitstream to your FPGA board using the appropriate programmer tool.

## Usage

1. Power on the FPGA board.
2. Use the physical buttons or switches on the board to:
   - Start/stop the timer
   - Switch turns between players
   - Reset the timer
3. Observe the timer display (LED/LCD).
